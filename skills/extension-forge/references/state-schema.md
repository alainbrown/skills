# `.forge-state.json` Schema

Written at the **user's project root** (never the skills repo). Created in `route`, updated after
every step, deleted in `done`.

## Field notes

- `scope`: `"new"` (scaffold extension + launch kit), `"wrap"` (existing extension; add only what's missing), or `"conform"` (existing, already-equipped extension; normalize layout/workflows to `references/conventions.md` — moves files + swaps workflows on a branch, never rewrites code).
- `conform`: only present for `scope: conform`. `branch` (the working branch), `plan` (the conformance table from `conform_assess`), `preserve` (repo-specific steps to keep), `moves` (applied relocations). Survives so a multi-repo conform run can resume.
- `extension.surfaces`: any of `popup`, `sidePanel`, `options`, `contentScript`, `newTab`, `contextMenu`. Each maps to a manifest key + a starter sub-directory.
- `extension.permissions` / `hostPermissions`: every entry must trace to a feature AND have a matching block in `references/permissions-reference.md`. Over-broad → CWS rejection.
- `context.demoBeats`: 3-6 moments → become Remotion scenes in the demo.
- `options.cwsAutoPublish`: `false` in this build — release is GitHub-Release-only.
- `options.voiceOver`: `true` to narrate the demo video. The `demo` step drafts `demo/narration.json` (user-approved) and renders via the Kokoro `voice` compose profile (`npm run render:voice`). Requires Docker; degrades to a silent render otherwise.
- `demo.rendered`: `false` when Docker was unavailable and the render was staged for the user to run.
- `demo.narrated`: `true` only after the voice-over actually rendered into `demo.mp4`. Stays `false` for silent renders and when voice was requested but fell back (no Docker/TTS).

This is a subagent contract: any field a generation subagent needs must live here, because the state
file is the only context those subagents receive.
